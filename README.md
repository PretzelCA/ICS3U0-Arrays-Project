# ICS3U0 Arrays Project

This project is a very loose simulation of a Canadian federal election written in Java.

You can either choose to vote or just watch the simulation of the election.

All 338 ridings are present and most of the parties are listed and voteable.
Although the following variables are randomized:
*  The voter turnout
*  The populationm per riding
*  MP names
